# DepudTabs-for-Safari
The first tab de-duplication extension for Safari. It'll automatically close duplicated tabs for you!

## Why?
Because there wasn't an extension to do this on the `Safari` world!

I have a problem with my mice on Mac which single middle wheel click often raises multiple click events.

It doesn't annoy me everything else but only on web browsers.
I'm fine with an extension on other browsers, but `Safari` doesn't have an extension what I wanted.

Other browsers have extensions that automatically close duplicated tabs like [Clutter Free](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clutter-free-prevent-dupl/iipjdmnoigaobkamfhnojmglcdbnfaaf) on Chrome.

## How to Install
### If you are a Developer/Programmer or something, you may know more than me.

So, see the codes, and give me some advice.

### If you are an `ordinary person` who don't know how to code.
Just download [DedupTabs.safariextz](https://github.com/luceat-lux-vestra/DedupTabs-for-Safari/blob/master/DedupTabs.safariextz)

and double click, you may need one or two more clicks on a popup window.
Just click `Yes` or `Trust` or something like that.

`Or...`, If you know about Safari's `Extension Builder`, go for it.

## State
I completed this some hours before.
I think **it works fine** but may have some issue.

## Epilogue
Eww, I spent so much time on doing this.

It was full of howlers.

I want to code like legendary developers, but I don't know things well for now.
